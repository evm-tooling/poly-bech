title: Runtime Not Available
description: What to do when the runtime you need isn't supported
---

If the runtime you need — for example, Java, Kotlin, or Swift — is not supported, you can add it. The process involves implementing the runtime spec, registering the plugin, and wiring init and build support.

<Aside type="note">
<span>Adding a runtime requires implementing the spec in poly-bench-traits, registering the plugin, and wiring init and build in poly-bench-project. The [Case Study: Python](/docs/developers/case-study-python) walks through a concrete example.</span>

## What's Involved

Adding a new runtime requires the following steps:

1. Implement the runtime spec — Runtime, RuntimeFactory, ErrorMapper, and RuntimePlugin from poly-bench-traits.
2. Register the plugin — Use `#[distributed_slice(PLUGINS)]` so poly-bench discovers it.
3. Add init and build support — Scaffold files in poly-bench-project (init, build, templates, deps).
4. Add LSP integration — VirtualFileBuilder, EmbeddedLspClient, and diagnostics (optional but recommended).
5. Write tests — Execution snapshot, LSP integration, and init runtime dirs.
